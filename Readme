\section*{Project Structure}
The project consists of multiple folders, each containing specific files and functionalities:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{DeepLabNet}: Contains scripts and pre-trained models for DeepLab.
\item \textbf{MembraneSegmentation}: Contains extracted and organized files for creating datasets and training segmentation models.
\item \textbf{MembraneSegmentationModify}: Improved version of the segmentation pipeline with enhanced accuracy.
\item \textbf{MyNet}: Includes custom-trained models and results.
\item \textbf{UNet}: Contains scripts and outputs related to UNet segmentation.
\item \textbf{adjust_code}: Placeholder for additional modifications or adjustments.
\end{itemize}

\section*{MembraneSegmentation Folder}
Based on the files provided by the teacher, I extracted the parts useful for my current work and organized them into the \texttt{MembraneSegmentation} folder.

\subsection*{How to Use}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Create Training and Validation Sets}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Run \texttt{CreatDatasets.py} to generate training and validation datasets.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Train Models}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Run \texttt{MainDeepLab.py} or \texttt{UnetMain.py} to train the respective models.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Training Accuracy}:
\begin{itemize}
\item The UNet model achieves approximately \textbf{91%} accuracy on the validation set.
\item The DeepLab model achieves approximately \textbf{86%} accuracy on the validation set.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Training Logs}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Training logs are stored in files:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{Unet_train_log_batchsize_2.txt}
\item \texttt{Unet_train_log_batchsize_4.txt}
\item \texttt{deeplab_train_log_batchsize_4.txt}
\end{itemize}
\item These logs can be found in the \texttt{MembraneSegmentation} folder.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Make Predictions}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Run \texttt{pred_deeplab.py} or \texttt{pred_unet.py} to predict the cell membrane on the test set.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Additionally, the folder contains example EM data, membrane data, and segmentation data:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{ac3_EM}
\item \texttt{ac3_dbseg_images}
\item \texttt{ac4_EM}
\item \texttt{ac4_seg_daniel}
\end{itemize}

\section*{MembraneSegmentationModify Folder}
This folder contains improvements made to the original \texttt{MembraneSegmentation} pipeline based on the reference program. After several parameter adjustments:
\begin{itemize}
\item The initial validation accuracy of \textbf{81%} was improved to approximately \textbf{90%}.
\item Significant enhancements were achieved in the experimental results.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{How to Use}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Create Training and Validation Sets}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Run \texttt{CreatMyDatasets.py} to generate training and validation datasets.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Train Models}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Run \texttt{TrainMyNetModify.py} to train the improved models.
\item Adjust parameters to optimize validation set accuracy.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Training Logs}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Select logs with better validation accuracy and store them in \texttt{MyNet_train_log.txt}.
\item The file \texttt{MyNet_train_log.txt} is located in the \texttt{MembraneSegmentationModify} folder.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Make Predictions}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Run \texttt{predMyNet.py} to predict the cell membrane on the test set.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Additionally, the folder contains corresponding EM data, membrane data, and segmentation data:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{ac3_EM}
\item \texttt{ac3_dbseg_images}
\item \texttt{ac4_EM}
\item \texttt{ac4_seg_daniel}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Summary}
This project showcases multiple segmentation approaches (DeepLab and UNet) for cell membrane detection. It includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Original implementations.
\item Improved pipelines with enhanced accuracy.
\item Comprehensive training and testing instructions.
\end{itemize}

Feel free to explore and use the provided scripts and models for your own segmentation tasks!
